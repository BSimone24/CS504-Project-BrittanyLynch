# CS504-Project-BrittanyLynch

For the moment, this team consists of Brittany Lynch and Brittany Lynch. 
As the week progress, I will update the README.md file accordingly with 
updates on new members and progress within the project

April 24, 2022

- The initial code for this project was created and written by Brittany Lynch
- The code was then shared to GitHub and will be there along with updates and screenshots
    for the next portion of this assignment
- The code will calculate the cost of purchasing a sneaker whether that is with a discount or above retail costs
- With this being an ongoing project, there will be multiple parts attached to this file
- The next piece is the case studies for the code

- The following are the instructions for the Individual Project 01:


Configuration Management is a very widely used process in managing complex systems, and software lifecycle is no exception. This process is integral for establishing and maintaining the consistency of the product throughout its life cycle. Software Configuration Management systems track and monitor changes to a software systems configuration metadata. This goes hand in hand with Version Control and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery which includes the build function as well.

One of the most challenging parts of designing a solution is choosing the platform and dependencies. There are certain services to assist with comparing different tools and making decisions. G2 is a peer-reviewing service for evaluating business software. Software Advice is another tool from a research and analyst company for reviewing software. StackOverflow Insights and StackShare can also be used to gain better clarity on the technologies and services being used.

Students can use any form of documentation or any of the popular options for CMS systems. Some options may include:

    Enterprise Level:
        IBM Rational ClearCase
        Azure DevOps Server
        Puppet Enterprise
        Chef Enterprise Automation Stack
        Perforce
    Open Source:
        Open Source Puppet
        Open Source Chef
            Chef Infra
            Chef Habitat
            Chef Automate
        Azure DevOps Server Express
        Red Hat Ansible 

Each student will implement and demonstrate test cases in a Configuration Management System (CMS) of their choice.

Specific instructions may be provided upon request in addition to the documentation of the CMS selected.

Once the CMS has been implemented, the student will create at least two accounts in the system, including one with applicable administrative rights.

The student will create test cases to demonstrate how the following situations are handled in the CMS. Below is a suggestion for the processes:

    Code checkout (or Git Clone)
    Code checkin (or Git Commit)
    Code Pull request
    Code Merge
    Code snapshot (or release point)
    Code in development by two users, first one checks out code, second checks out code, makes changes and checks in, first makes changes and needs to check in.
    Code changes need to be rolled back to a previous version (revert).
    One developer is working on a new version, one is fixing bugs in a previous release (Git fork).
    Define runtime variable for your software
    Deploy the software on your local machine or a cloud
    Write a CMS playbook (configuration file) to change the runtime variable in the configuration file.

Each process must be documented.
